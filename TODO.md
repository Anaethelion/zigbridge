#Todo

* Ensure that dual thread architecture is the proper solution to ZNP framework
  usage
* Find a proper architecture for general application state machine
* Redefine log levels : log_level_low_info is not usefull, if not
  misunderstanding. Moreover, order does not seemed to be respected in libznp
(eg : byte debug at higher debug level)
* implement UTIL function to get device state
